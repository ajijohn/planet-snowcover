    "\n",
    "Amazon Sagemaker is a managed machine learning service which allows us to easily experiment with different configurations of input data without having to worry about the computational infrastructure involved in training a complex model on large volumes of data. We use this tool to produce our trained models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sagemaker works by ingesting a pre-packaged set of **training and inference code**, along with the necessary environment, and running this package on hardware you specify. This package comes in the form of a Docker container. We have created this container such that it contains all of our custom ML code (you can see the specification in `../pipeline/sagemaker/Dockerfile`), and it lives in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry with the following tag: `675906086666.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/planet-snowcover:latest`. This container is not publicly accessible, but is accessible to anyone with AWS credentials. \n",

If you've run `aws configure`, you'll have an AWS credentials file containing your credentials, most likely under the `default` profile. Running the following cell will tell you which profile names have associated credentials currently configured on your computer. ⚠️ **Note**: if the following cell has no output, you don't have AWS credentials configured. Go back to the [Deployment Guide](../deployment/README.md) to learn how to do this."
